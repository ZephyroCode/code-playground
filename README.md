# Zephyro Code Playground

Hiya! Well, this repo was made to save random tests, notes and other stuff.

This is **NOT** a full project, nor a serious project. It's just me playing around and messing things up.

If you want a real project, you can check my other repos, such as my [VSCode Color Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ZephyroCode.zephyr-nights-theme "Zephyr Nights Theme"), my [Blog](https://zephyrocode.github.io "Zephyro's Blog"), and so on.

I'm also working on some more _decent_ notes, kinda like my personal docs.

I'll let you know when they're done.
